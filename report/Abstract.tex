Internet outages in BGP are critical and lead to long convergence times . \\
Industrial scale software defined Internet exchange points in short iSDX, suffer like any other BGP speaking router from this problem. Existing fast reroute frameworks like Swift can help shorten convergence times. In this work we implement Swift into the iSDX. Swift can be easily implemented into the iSDX due their similar architecture. \\
Without a lot of overhead the convergence time of all the participants of the iSDX is improved by up to a factor $60$. But as both Swift and the iSDX use the destination mac address to encode information the amount of bits available to Swift and iSDX is reduced. This impacts Swift performance and the iSDX's ability to scale with a higher number of participants.
