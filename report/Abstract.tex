Internet outages in BGP are critical and lead to long convergence times . \\
Industrial-Scale Software defined Internet exchange Points in short iSDX, suffer like any other BGP speaking router from this problem. This is made even worse because of the additional overhead induced by the iSDX's participant policies. Existing fast reroute frameworks like Swift can help shorten convergence times. In this work we implement Swift into the iSDX. Swift can be easily implemented into the iSDX due their similar architecture. \\
Without a lot of additional overhead, the convergence time of the iSDX is improved by up to a factor 60. But as both Swift and the iSDX use the destination mac address as a data plane tag the amount of bits available to encode information for the iSDX and Swift is halved. This reduces the iSDX's ability to scale with higher number of participants.
