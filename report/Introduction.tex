\chapter{\label{introduction}Introduction}
\rb{try to extend the introduction and get a better flow. it reads like multiple fragments. all of a sudden SDN comes into play. Always write Internet with a capital I.}
The border gateway protocol (BGP) is the glue that holds the Internet together by allowing autonomous networks to exchange information about the reachability of prefixes without revealing their own network infrastructure. \\
Remote disruptions in BGP can lead to convergence times of multiple minutes. This long convergence time is caused by the way BGP updates are propagated through the Internet. The convergence time is lower bounded by the time it takes for all BGP withdrawal updates to be received. \\
Software-defined networking allows network operators to have more control over the network routing. It is also a technology that can help solve some of the Internet's problems including long BGP convergence times. \rb{why?}\\
In this work we show that it is possible to improve the convergence time at software-defined exchange points, such as the industrial scale internet exchange point (iSDX) using the Swift framework. As both the iSDX and Swift rely on a similar infrastructure to enable their functionality, it is a good idea to integrate Swift into iSDX. \\
\rb{something is broken in the labels: why is there no reference to chapter 3?}
In the following, We will first provide some background on BGP, iSDX and Swift in \ref{chapter2}. Then we describe the motivation behind implementing Swift in the iSDX in \ref{chapter3}. In \ref{chapter4} we evaluate the system both in terms of convergence time and introduced overhead and discuss the results in \ref{chapter5}.
