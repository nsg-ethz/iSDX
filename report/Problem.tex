\chapter{\label{chapter2}Problem/Motivation}

\rb{Motivation and Problem Description: All routers using BGP are affected by long convergence times after BGP update bursts. At an iSDX many BGP routers are present. The architecture of the iSDX is very similar to what SWIFT requires. Hence, implementing SWIFT at iSDX is a natural fit: architecture is similar and many IXP participants can benefit from a single SWIFT deployments. Therefore, problem is to integrate SWIFT into iSDX. We try to change as little as possible in both systems.\\\\ this is just a very concise idea of what this section should look like. you need to elaborate.}

The iSDX takes a long time to converge upon remote failure. The main problem is that the iSDX needs to do some additional computing a traditional BGP-router does not need to do. \\
When receiving a withdrawal the iSDX participant controller updates it's RIB, checks if the policy flow rules have changed and if the virtual next hop/vmac has changed. This additional computation adds a significant overhead to the convergence time of the iSDX. \\
Implementing Swift into the iSDX promises to significantly reduce the convergence time. Convergence time being the time until packets get sent to the correct participant and not into a black hole. \\
The main reason why implementing Swift in the iSDX is reasonable is their similar architecture. Both the iSDX and Swift use a SDN switch to program flow rules to steer traffic. They both are connected to BGP speaking routers and receive BGP updates from them. Swift and iSDX both use the destination mac address to encode information about a prefix and use the next-hop to map this vmac to a prefix. In addition the swift framework allows multiple swifted routers to be connected to the SDN switch, which in the iSDX's case means that all the participants will benefit from Swift.
