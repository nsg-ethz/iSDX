\chapter{\label{chapter3}Motivation}




All routers using BGP suffer from long convergence times after remote failure. This is mainly due to the propagation delay of the updates. At an iSDX many BGP routers are present and the propagation delay is made even worse because of the additional computation the participant controller needs to do to process a BGP update. Only once the participant controller has finished processing the update can the update be sent to the border router of its participant.  \\
When receiving a BGP update the iSDXs route server first forwards the update to the participant controllers. The participant controller updates it's RIB, checks if the policy flow rules have changed and if the Virtual Next-Hop/VMAC has changed. This additional computation adds a significant overhead to the time until the participants border router receives the BGP update. Which in turn impacts the convergence time of the routers connected to the iSDX. \\
Implementing Swift into the iSDX promises to significantly reduce the convergence time. Convergence time being the time until packets get sent to the correct participant and not into a black hole. The idea being that Swift can push fast-reroute flow rules into the SDN switch and redirect packets to a backup participants.\\
The main reason why implementing Swift in the iSDX is reasonable is their architecture. The architecture of the iSDX is very similar to what Swift requires. Both the iSDX and Swift use a SDN switch to program flow rules to steer traffic. They both are connected to BGP speaking routers and receive BGP updates from them. Swift and iSDX both use the destination mac address to encode information about a prefix and use the next-hop to map this VMAC to a prefix. In addition the Swift framework allows multiple swifted routers to be connected to the SDN switch, which in the iSDX's case means that all the participants will benefit from Swift. \\
The main challenge when implementing Swift into iSDX is to change as little as possible in both systems. Utilising their similar architecture to keep the full functionality of both iSDX and Swift. At the same time also making sure that Swift does not add too much overhead to the processing of a BGP update. \\
In the next chapter we explain how Swift was implemented in the iSDX.
